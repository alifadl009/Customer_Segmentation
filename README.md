Customer Segmentation Project
</h1>


## Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation, where we aim to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and data analysis, we can gain valuable insights into customer segments, allowing businesses to create targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize revenue.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/customer-segmentation-dataset). It contains transactional data for an online retail business, including customer information, purchase history, and other relevant attributes.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** We start by loading the dataset and exploring its structure, identifying any missing values or anomalies.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** We handle missing data, address any inconsistencies, and perform feature engineering to create meaningful variables for analysis.

3. **Customer Segmentation:** Using K-means clustering, we segment the customers into distinct groups based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value.

4. **Evaluation:** We evaluate the segmentation model using silhouette scores and inertia to determine the optimal number of clusters.

5. **Results and Interpretation:** With the identified customer segments, we analyze the characteristics and behaviors of each group, providing actionable insights for the business.

## How to Use

To reproduce the results or perform your analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`customer-segmentation.ipynb`) using Jupyter or any compatible notebook environment.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the data analysis and segmentation process.
